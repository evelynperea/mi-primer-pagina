            <p>
                Jungwon is a person who is known for keeping his promises. Thus far, he has never broken a promise he
                has made with Engenes. He enjoys engaging with fans, meeting fan requests, and interacting almost daily
                with Engenes on social media. He is usually the first to get up in the morning, and he helps wake up the
                rest of the members. He is often the last to shower after his members, and He will turn the shower tap
                to cold before he exits because his grandmother taught him that it would conserve the utility bills.
                Jungwon doesn’t usually play computer games, but he does occasionally play to get closer to the other
                members. Jungwon has a caring personality, and often brings things in his bag for the benefit of the
                other members. For example, he carried mosquito repellant for Sunghoon for a shoot because he knew
                Sunghoon was allergic to mosquito bites.

            <p>
                Heeseung is a perfectionist: “Some people think deeply about one thing, and others think about a lot of
                things.Along with Jungwon, he was considered as one of the candidates to become the leader of ENHYPEN.
                Heeseung decided to focus on his responsibilities as the eldest of the group. His favourite expression
                is “it’s no big deal.” He said, “whether I'm in a good or bad situation, if I say it to myself, it calms
                me down.” His favorite movie is Toy Story because the movie’s theme centers around memories, which he
                finds touching. The members voted Heeseung as the funniest member many times since he likes to crack
                jokes.

                remembering small things people around him say or do. Even though Sunghoon can be more quiet around

                set.
