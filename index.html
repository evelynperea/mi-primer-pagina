                <p>
                    Jungwon is a person who is known for keeping his promises. Thus far, he has never broken a promise
                    he
                    has made with Engenes. He enjoys engaging with fans, meeting fan requests, and interacting almost
                    daily
                    with Engenes on social media. He is usually the first to get up in the morning, and he helps wake up
                    the
                    rest of the members. He is often the last to shower after his members, and He will turn the shower
                    tap
                    to cold before he exits because his grandmother taught him that it would conserve the utility bills.
                    Jungwon doesn’t usually play computer games, but he does occasionally play to get closer to the
                    other
                    members. Jungwon has a caring personality, and often brings things in his bag for the benefit of the
                    other members. For example, he carried mosquito repellant for Sunghoon for a shoot because he knew
                    Sunghoon was allergic to mosquito bites.

                <p>
                    Heeseung is a perfectionist: “Some people think deeply about one thing, and others think about a lot
                    of
                    things.Along with Jungwon, he was considered as one of the candidates to become the leader of
                    ENHYPEN.
                    Heeseung decided to focus on his responsibilities as the eldest of the group. His favourite
                    expression
                    is “it’s no big deal.” He said, “whether I'm in a good or bad situation, if I say it to myself, it
                    calms
                    me down.” His favorite movie is Toy Story because the movie’s theme centers around memories, which
                    he
                    finds touching. The members voted Heeseung as the funniest member many times since he likes to crack
                    jokes.
